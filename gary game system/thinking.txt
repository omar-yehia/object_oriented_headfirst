Gary game system

it is a system
used by game designers
to build board games
so the most essential thing here is the BOARD
the  board visually is like a chess board for example
a 2d grid
as a data structure, we will use a 2d array (or 3d if you want a 3d board system)

board has cells
each cell is called a tile
each tile has a type  of material called terrain 

there are units (like soldiers, tanks, airplanes....)
the units can be on a tile on the board
can  move from tile to tile
some moves are forbidden / not allowed
units can fight each other
it is a turn-based game
