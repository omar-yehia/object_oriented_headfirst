day#30 ooa&d headfirst

continue iteration 1 (last part of implementation - the testing)
start iteration 2 (second use case)

what is the second usecase ??
the user uses INITIATE the search method from the inventory
(the user is an actor/ an external initiator for this use case)

how would you implement the search??
take the  list of all instruments in the inventroy
loop over them
for each one 
compare to the search criteria
(the array  [instead of map in java])

if any mismatch, return false
else if all true(matched)
append to the  list of matching instruments 
and after the loop 
return the  list of matching instruments

so, search takes in , search  criteria (an array)
returns a list of instrument objects

===========
iteration#2
the search use case

requirements (use case DONE, requirements list, )
requirements list:
- inventroy can search for instrument by properties
and return all matching instruments (not just the first one)


analysis:
textual analysis ??? 
search -> verb-> candidate method
inventory &  instruments are already classes

design
just add the search  method to the inventory class

implementation
let's gooo

finished 

next steps??

:/
the Gary game framework
and the subway  system :D

I haven't used any abstract classes so far :/

nor interfaces
I need to apply on them !!
nor did I create  a complicated class diagram
