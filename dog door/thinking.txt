doog barks
the  owner presses a button on a remote controller
to open the dog door
the  door is opened for a specific amount of time

or the dog sensor can hear the dog bark and recognize its bark if it is valid the recognizer opens the door also temporarily for a timer
the door is closed automatically after timer is over




feature list
1- dog door can be opend by a remote control
2- dog door can be opend by a bark recognizer device
3- dog door closes automatically after a specific amount of time
4- remote has a button to open and close the door (if not already closed)
5- bark recognizer has some barks saved as valid, those are the  ones accepted 


use case diagrams
actors:
1- dog
2- dog owner

use case titles ?
recognizer open the door
press button to open/close the door

dog interacts with  the recognizer , it is the external initiator that initiate the recognizing process
dog owner interacts with the remote, it is the external initiator that starts the button press process /method





breaking  up the  problem
first use case
dog barks
device recognizes bark (compares the bark against saved barks)
device send message to door calling the open method
the door opens ITSELF

second use case
owner press the button 
the remote sends a message to the door to open itself 
or close itself if it is open

in both cases the door closes automatically after some timeout






understanding the problem well
?? what else ??

iteration #1
bark recognizer

requirements
a device to recognize the bark
device can have some barks saved
device can compare input barks to saved barks
device can send a message to the door to open itself


analysis
textual analysis
device class 
bark??
validateBark method
door class 
open method
close method


design

Device
---------
barks:array
door:Door
addBark  -> no need to do that , as we are going to provide them in the constructor
validateBark:bool
openForBark(string):void

Door
----------------
________________
open():void
close():void



implementation
ok lets go
make the Door , Device classes
and their methods and  attributes

ok now lets test this functionality

:)

=====================
iteration #2
the second use case
the owner presses the remote button 
to open the door 
or close if already opened :D

- requirements
- analysis
- design
- implementation

requirements list?
system has a remote
remote has a button
on button press, sends message to the  door to open , or send message to close if already opened

2-analysis
textual analysis
nouns: remote,button, door already a class 
verbs: press button, send message , open & close already methods in door

design: nothing ,just the remote class with the pressButton method

implementation
testing
